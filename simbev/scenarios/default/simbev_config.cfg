# efficiency of charging points
# step size of simulation (should stay at 15 min, best results)
# start and end date of simulation in format YYY-MM-DD
# soc_min: minimum percentage of battery charge left after a drive
# vehicle_csv: output csv per individual vehicle, can be disabled if only looking for grid timeseries
