# basic parameters for the simulation
# ===========================
# definition of regional type to use for simulating driving behaviour
# efficiency of charging points
# timesteps (should stay at 15 min, best results)
# number of days to simulate, max: 14, suggested: 14 for best results
# minimum soc allowed before fast charging event is triggered
# grid_timeseries enables additional outputs, options: true, false
